### TODO
- keep selected when updating treeview
- make it run in http://threejs.org page
  - window.frames[0].frameElement.contentWindow.THREE
  - possible solution
    - what about a detection of the page ? if detected point on the 
    - add a tab in the right sidebar with a list of all examples
- support keyboard binding in treeview
  - how to get to the 'next item' or 'previous item'
- selection in treeview should be visible in the 3d
  - bounding box attached to the scene
  - 10-inspected-win-selectbbox.js
- material.map.image.url undefined when canvas as texture
  - issue with http://127.0.0.1:3000/examples/webgl_materials_video.html
- support for large texture
  - especially in drag drop
  - issue with the url size... maybe to scale it down via canvas ?
  - reduce resolution until .toDataURL string is less than 2mbyte
  - This is a async process so do it on reception of the upload
- SPEED: add a message counter in the source
  - apparently the update are super slow...
  - maybe there are a lot of message shared between window
  - if so, one can reduce the number of message by packing them together
  - it seems more like a number of eval from panel to inspected page
  - the capture scene could pack the message too
- could we controls the camera ? 
  - aka remove the other controllers and put mine...
- DONE detect when the scene is updated, and update the treeview
  - early version in src/panel/inspected-win/10-inspected-win-instrument3js.js
- DONE on scene refresh, be sure the inspected object3d is still present
  - if so update it
- DONE add a 'NO SCENE' in the left panel
  - how to know there are no scene ?
- DONE find an automatic way to identify when you run in -dev or in prod
  - change things based on it... 
  - simple principle: even patch number are dev version, odd patch number
  - maybe thanks to the url ?
- DONE add the date in the three.js inspector

### old TODO
- bug in treeview
  - it is does empty on http://127.0.0.1:3000/examples/webgl_geometry_cube.html
  - debug treeView.empty() in standalone page
- check how the previous extension is doing the detection
  - see what you can learn from it
- remove the debug console.log when releasing
- if scene isnt found, notify it with an alert in inspected window

### About detection
- on page reload, test if can inspect scene
- on panel show, test if can inspect scene
- on button press, test if can inspect scene
- on timer interval, test if can inspect scene
